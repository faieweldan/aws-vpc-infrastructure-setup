# AWS VPC Setup - Console Method

This guide walks through creating VPC infrastructure using the AWS web console interface.

Prerequisites

- AWS account
- IAM admin user (not root user)
- Logged into AWS Console

Step 1: Navigate to VPC Service

1. In AWS Console search bar, type "VPC"
2. Select VPC from the dropdown menu
3. Ensure you're in the correct region (top-right corner) - use region closest to you

About the Default VPC

You'll notice a VPC already exists in your account. AWS automatically creates a default VPC when you create your account, which is why you can launch EC2 instances immediately without setting up networking first.

Step 2: Create VPC

1. In left navigation pane, click Your VPCs
2. Click Create VPC button
3. Configure VPC settings:
   - Resources to create: Select "VPC only"
   - Name tag: NextWork VPC
   - IPv4 CIDR block: Select "IPv4 CIDR manual input"
   - IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
   - IPv6 CIDR block: "No IPv6 CIDR block"
   - Tenancy: Default
4. Click Create VPC

Understanding CIDR Blocks

10.0.0.0/16 means the first 16 bits (10.0) are fixed and the last 16 bits can vary. This gives you 65,536 total IP addresses, ranging from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255.

Smaller number after the slash means bigger address range. For example, /8 gives you 16 million addresses while /24 gives you only 256 addresses.

Step 3: Create Subnet

1. In left navigation pane, click Subnets
2. Click Create subnet
3. Configure subnet settings:
   - VPC ID: Select NextWork VPC
   - Subnet name: Public 1
   - Availability Zone: Select first AZ in list (e.g., us-east-1a)
   - IPv4 subnet CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/24
4. Click Create subnet

Why This Isn't Public Yet

Even though we named it "Public 1", this subnet has no internet access yet. It becomes truly public only after we attach an internet gateway and update route tables. We'll do the gateway part in this project.

Step 4: Enable Auto-Assign Public IPv4

This setting automatically gives EC2 instances a public IP when launched in this subnet.

1. Select the checkbox next to Public 1 subnet
2. Click Actions and then Edit subnet settings
3. Check the box: Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address
4. Click Save

Why This Matters

Private IP is automatic and used for communication within VPC. Public IP needs to be enabled and is used for communication with internet. Without auto-assign enabled, you'd need to manually allocate public IPs to each instance.

Step 5: Create Internet Gateway

1. In left navigation pane, click Internet Gateways
2. Click Create internet gateway
3. Configure:
   - Name tag: NextWork IG
4. Click Create internet gateway

About Internet Gateways

An internet gateway is like a bridge connecting your private VPC to the public internet. Without it, resources in your VPC are completely isolated. They can talk to each other but not to the outside world.

Step 6: Attach Internet Gateway to VPC

After creating the gateway, it's in a "detached" state and not doing anything yet.

1. With your new gateway still selected, click Actions and then Attach to VPC
2. Select NextWork VPC
3. Click Attach internet gateway

You should see a green success banner confirming attachment.

Verify Attachment

1. Go to Internet Gateways in left nav
2. Find your NextWork IG
3. Check the State column - should say "Attached"
4. Check the VPC ID column - should show your VPC ID

Step 7: Verify Your Setup

Check VPC:
1. Navigate to Your VPCs
2. Find NextWork VPC
3. Verify CIDR is 10.0.0.0/16

Check Subnet:
1. Navigate to Subnets
2. Find Public 1
3. Verify VPC ID matches NextWork VPC
4. Verify CIDR is 10.0.0.0/24
5. Verify Auto-assign public IPv4 is "Yes"

Check Internet Gateway:
1. Navigate to Internet Gateways
2. Find NextWork IG
3. Verify State is "Attached"

Architecture Overview

Your setup now looks like this:

Internet
    |
Internet Gateway: NextWork IG
    |
VPC: NextWork VPC - 10.0.0.0/16
    |
Subnet: Public 1 - 10.0.0.0/24 (in us-east-1b)

What's Missing for Full Internet Access

While we've attached an internet gateway, resources in "Public 1" still can't reach the internet. Why? Route tables. We haven't told the subnet to use the internet gateway for outbound traffic. 

In a production setup, you'd need to create or modify route table, add route 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to Internet Gateway, and associate route table with subnet. For this learning project, we focused on the core VPC components.

Cleanup

When you're done exploring, delete resources to avoid charges:

1. Detach Internet Gateway:
   - Internet Gateways, select NextWork IG, Actions, Detach from VPC

2. Delete Internet Gateway:
   - Actions, Delete internet gateway

3. Delete Subnet:
   - Subnets, select Public 1, Actions, Delete subnet

4. Delete VPC:
   - Your VPCs, select NextWork VPC, Actions, Delete VPC

Console vs CLI Comparison

Console Advantages:
- Visual confirmation at each step
- Easier to understand relationships between resources
- Better for learning AWS concepts
- No need to remember command syntax

Console Disadvantages:
- Slower (multiple page loads and clicks)
- Harder to replicate setup across environments
- Can't version control in Git
- Manual process means more room for human error

Common Issues

"VPC CIDR block size must be between /16 and /28"
Solution: Use CIDR like 10.0.0.0/16, not /8 or /32

"Subnet CIDR overlaps with existing subnet"
Solution: Each subnet needs unique IP range (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)

"Cannot delete VPC - has dependencies"
Solution: Delete subnets and IGW first, then VPC
